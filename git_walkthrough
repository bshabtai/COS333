HOW TO GIT
To interface with github from a shell:
cd to the parent directory of where you want this COS333 directory to go
type 'git init'
type 'git clone https://github.com/bshabtai/COS333'
cd COS333
now you have the most recent version of the directory
note you only have to do this one time, just to download this directory
after creating a new file called filename and editing type 'git add filename'
type 'git commit -a -m "message about file"'
type git push
enter login info
If you only edit a file in the repo (not adding a new file) you don't have to doa 'git add filename' command

HOW TO GIT
To interface with github from a shell:

First download this directory ("repo"):
cd to the parent directory of where you want this COS333 directory to go
type 'git init'
type 'git clone https://github.com/bshabtai/COS333'
cd COS333
now you have the most recent version of the directory
note you only have to do this one time, just to download this directory
you can change the name of this directory on your machine (with an mv COS333 newDirName) without affecting the repo

then, from within the directory, you can add/edit files and push them to github.
just for adding a file:
after creating a new file called filename and editing type 'git add filename'

adding/editing a file:
type 'git commit -a -m "message about file"' (-a adds all files that are part of repo, -m is for the message)
type git push
enter login info

Note that every time you open up the shell to edit, you should do a 'git pull' to update to the most recent version of the database.

there's also a github application for windows. i'm not too familiar with it, but it has a nice gui and lets you push files on the pc.
